         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And of the Penitence of <hi>Ralph Markland</hi> a Notorious CLIPPER, who was Reprieved. AS ALSO Of <hi>JOHN NEALE</hi> who was Executed at <hi>Tyburn.</hi> With the Behaviour of thoſe other five who received Sentence the laſt Seſſions, but Three were Reprieved, and Two received Pardons.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THough ſeldome any Seſſions ends without being attended with Tragical E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>events, yet ſo prone is Man to hurry himſelf upon dangers, that are ſtill at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ignominy and ſhame, that no Examples are of weight to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain him from the villanies that are the cauſers of his miſeries: although the danger is imminent, and the Law preſcribes it death to act them, yet the hopes of eſcaping the Eyes of Men, prompts them on in ſecret, and encourages them to dip their hands in Blood, and to perpetrate other Crimes, little inferiour to the ſame; not imagining that the all-ſeeing God, who never ſlumbers, but with an Eternal wake views the large circumference of Heaven and Earth, beholds their dark contrivances, and when he pleaſes, brings them to the bar of Juſtice, to anſwer in the open day for deeds of darkneſs, and receive ſuch puniſhments as they have merited; for through the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages ſince the world began, it has been curiouſly obſerved amongſt the multiplicity of evils that have happened, that ſeldome the ſhedders of Innocent blood have eſcaped ſcot free, but by one means or other have been brought to light, though many years have intervened, which (as the Murtherers thought) were like veils to hide their guilts or bury them in oblivion, but like</hi> Agag <hi>they were deceived, when they flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves with</hi> (ſurely the fear of death is over-paſt.)</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45676:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sixteenth of <hi>September</hi> laſt, one Mr. <hi>Dimbleby,</hi> a ſervant to the Wardrobe-keeper of <hi>Hampton-court;</hi> and with him as acceſſary to the ſaid Murther, was likewiſe Indicted one <hi>George Granger,</hi> a Coachman to a perſon of Quality; <hi>Nicholſon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Trade a Carpenter, upon his firſt Apprehenſion and now at the Bar did confeſs, that he himſelf did the Murder; having in a moſt barbarous manner cleft his Head with an Ax, which was produced in Court. But he alſo added, That the Coachman Arraigned with him did put him upon, and bribe him to do that horrid Deed; becauſe, he ſaid, he had ſpoken ill words of ſomebody he belong'd to; promiſing to give him <hi>Fourty Shillings and a better thing</hi> [for ſo were his words] <hi>for the ſame,</hi> and that thereupon he did it; but had no body could prove any of all this. Only it was proved, that when it was told the Coachman, that ſuch an one was Murdered, he ſaid, It was no matter, for he uſed to ſpeak ill of a Perſon of Quality, or words to that effect, on which he was taken upon Suſpicion. But this did not ſeem a ſufficient proof to Convict, ſeveral perſons of Eſteem teſtifying his honeſt Converſation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo he was found Not Guilty. But the other, who confeſſed he did the Murder, and afterwards took the Gentlemans Money out of his Pockets and his Watch, which when he was taken he was found expoſing to ſale, was moſt juſtly Condemned, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Sentence of death, being much dejected, and looked as if a lumpiſh hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs or ſtupifying inſenſibility had ſeized him: all that could be got out of him was, that he did the Murther, and that the Coachman hired him, he having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted it three times before, but had no power to do it; ſo powerful is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to check ſuch bold and unlawful Enterprizes, till by obſtinacy it is feared, or put to ſilence. During the interview of time, between Sentence and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he many times was obſerved to retire in private, and ſtrive to pray, but was often over-powred, with ſtrong temptaions, till by the prevalent prayers of ſeveral Godly Miniſters, heaven was entreated, and by power divine melted his ſtony heart, ſo that he was obſerved to weep and bemoan himſelf for his miſ-deeds, ſeeming very willing to Dye, ſo that he might be ſure of an Immortal ſtate of happineſs hereafter, deſiring all to pray for him, that the blood that lay ſo heavy on his Conſcience, might be waſhed away by the precious blood of his merciful Redeemer, and ſo continued for the moſt part, not being ſo much as daunted when the Smith came to take meaſure of him, in order to the making of his Chains; for ſuch was his doom, to be hanged up in the ſame, as a terrible Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to all ſuch bold and deſperate wretches, that ſhall dare cauſeleſly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Image of their great Creator. In the morning betimes he was convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a great Guard and a numerous company of people, who went out of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to <hi>Hounſlow-heath,</hi> as near as was convenient to the place where the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was done, and there Hanged till he was dead; and then the Irons riveted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Neck, and under his Arms, and there left a diſmal ſpectacle to all that paſs that way.</p>
            <p>Where leaving him, I ſhall proceed to the reſt, which was <hi>Ralph Mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for High-Treaſon, he received his Tryal with his Wife, and Maid-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and a Refiner that dwelt in <hi>Grub-ſtreet,</hi> all Indicted for High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for Clipping and Impairing the Kings Coin; <hi>Markland</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been a Brewer, and lived in good faſhion, but failed, and was Impriſoned in the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> there Poverty, and an Ill Conſcience, and bad Company, taught him this miſchievous Clipping Trade; which he has ſince followed to great advantage, living like a Gentleman by the Ditch-ſide in <hi>Black-fryars.</hi> The Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt him, was, One that being informed he was a Clipper, got a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and in ſearching his Houſe, found a ſhilling under a Cheſt of Drawers, juſt newly Clipt, and not ſo much as rounded; and alſo two low ſtools on which they were wont to rub the Money after they had Circumciſed it. Another perſon a poor woman gathering Herbs in St. <hi>Georges</hi> fields, found two pair of ſhears, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45676:2"/>
being adviſed to carry them to ſome Workmen that made ſuch Inſtruments, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to light on the very Man that made them, who being examined, ſwore that he ſold them to Mr. <hi>Markland,</hi> and that what with new-ſteeling, and all, he had had of him four pair. <hi>Markland</hi> was askt what uſe he put thoſe ſhears to, being a Brewer, which Trade has no need of ſuch Tools; wherefore being able to aſſign no occaſion, he utterly denyed that he had any ſhears at all of the Witneſs, which rendred all the reſt of his defence little regardable. But beſides, there was one ſwore, that he had bargained with him to give him twenty two ſhillings in Clipt Money, for Twenty ſhillings fair and large, and that he had actually allowed him that advantage, they having dealt ſo long on that ſcore, as to have Exchanged five or ſix hundred pounds. But that which put all out of doubt, was the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of one of the ſame Gang, that he had actually ſeen him Clipping, ſo that there was no colour of excuſe, but he was found guilty. After he had received Sentence, he behaved himſelf with great patience, carrying a Map of ſorrow in his face, and with a ſincere penitence, bewailing his miſ-doing, and the fraud he had put upon the Nation, by diminiſhing the lawful Coin, and taking from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſhilling to the value of two pence, and from every half-Crown three pence. His Sentence was as the Law requires in that caſe, to be drawn upon a Hurdle to the place of Execution, and there to be Hanged and Quartered. In <hi>Newgate</hi> he was obſerved to be exceeding penitent, and had abundance of friends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance came to viſit him; as likewiſe ſeveral good Miniſters, Phyſicians of the Soul, whoſe good inſtructions are the great Preſervatives againſt the ſecond death, by ſtrengthning them for to reſiſt the temptations that at the near approach of this diſſolution are forcible and many, for then the ſubtle tempter is moſt bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie with his falſe ſuggeſtions. He ſeemed very willing, had it been in his power, to make reſtitution for the wrong he had done, but not being in a capacity, he deſired that all good Chriſtians would accept of the will for the deed, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till the great ſummons of death bid him prepare him for Immortality.</p>
            <p>The Refiner had been formerly queſtioned and got off, and ſo to he did now, there being no direct proof, but that he held a Correſpondence with the other, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo neither could it be fixt on his Wife or Maid, that they were actually concerned in, or privy to it, though ſome Evidence and Circumſtances were offered to that purpoſe; ſo theſe three were Acquitted.</p>
            <p>A little Boy, ſcarce high enough to peep over the Bar, was Convicted of petty Larceny, for ſtealing a Gentleman's Handkerchief: And an honeſt Coal-heaver to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Ratcliffe,</hi> who alſo keeps a Victualing-houſe, was Indicted on a matter, which in it ſelf appeared by the Evidence to be a very barbarous Robbery, and a great deal of Plate and other things of conſiderable Value ſtollen; amongſt which was a Watch, which the now Priſoner bringing to a Watchmakers only to know its value, and there being Bills abroad deſcribing it, the ſame was ſtopt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Priſoner queſtioned: who proved by ſufficient Witneſſes, that the manner of his coming by it was thus; A perſon owing him eighteen pence (as he kept a publick-houſe) comes and pays it, and afterwards in diſcourſe tells him, that if he would lend him twenty Shillings, he would leave him a ſufficient Pawn. The man at firſt refuſed, but was at laſt prevailed upon by his Importunity to do it, the other promiſing to return the Money in two or three Hours; but not hearing of him for a long time, goes as aforeſaid to enquire the value of his Pawn: Nor had he been wanting in endeavours to finde out the Fellow that brought it to him; which as yet he had not been able to do, though he had been at great Charges therein: Wherefore proving the delivery of it to him, and alſo produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing people of Credit that juſtified his Reputation, he was Acquitted, but juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Execution received a Reprieve.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elizabeth Hull</hi> received Sentence with the former, for ſtealing Twenty eight pounds from one Mr. <hi>Hadcock,</hi> with whom ſhe had lived in the manner of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45676:3"/>
but watching her opportunity, broke open his Trunk, and took out the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Monies. The proof was plain againſt her, nor could ſhe deny it, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sentence heartily repented her of ſuch her miſ-doing, deſiring pardon for her Offence, ſaying ſhe was perſwaded to it, and that ſhe hoped God and her Maſter would forgive her, as ſhe freely forgave all that had done her any injury, and ſo continued very penitent, bewailing much her miſerable ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Priſcilla Wyn,</hi> and <hi>Katherine Johnſon</hi> received Sentence with the reſt for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Robberies, the former for ſtealing a Silver Porringer, and latter for ſtealing Cloth, and a Silver Tankard; <hi>Johnſon</hi> had been an old Offender, and went by ſeveral Names; but by pleading their Bellies were found pregnant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Execution was ſtaid till the time they ſhall be Delivered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward Whitwick</hi> and <hi>John Watkins</hi> received Sentence alſo for killing of one <hi>Smith</hi> a Watchman, he being wounded by the latter on the 29th of <hi>May</hi> laſt, and dyed about the 18th of <hi>September;</hi> the former was a Coſter-monger or Fruiterer, and the latter a Gardiner; they lived both of them in the Pariſh of St. <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Clerkenwell.</hi> And at their receiving of Sentence, the Jury entreated the Court to requeſt the Kings Mercy for them; which was accordingly done, and they received their Pardons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Neale,</hi> a young Fellow, was found guilty of a Felony and Burglary; he and Eleven more of the Gang, violently entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Countrey-houſe, and binding the people, took away Goods of a great value, and Nineteen pound in ready Money. The Miſtreſs of the Houſe Swore directly that the Priſoner was one of them, ſo did alſo another priſoner who was in the Robbery, and that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf made Four pound of his ſhare of the booty; nor did the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal at Bar deny the Fact. But a Broker Indicted as acceſſary, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bought a Wedding Ring, which the Gentlewoman found in his ſhop, made ſhift to get off, but he was Condemned for the aforeſaid Robbery, having been an old Thief, as well at the Foot-pad as break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Houſes. He very much importuned the Bench for Tranſportation, but it would not be granted him; ſo that being carried back to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> he began to conſult his Eternal welfare, and was very ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous with ſeveral Miniſters to come to beſtow their good Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon theſe dying wretches in general, and to be inſtructed how to make his peace with Heaven before he parted with his Mortal ſtate for Immortality, often deſiring to hear diſcourſe about Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to be made ſenſible what that unbounded Infinity was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was comprehended by time, or had no end, deſiring the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of all who came to viſit him, ſaying, <hi>He had been a grievous Sinner, but hoped that God would pardon the follies of his Youth;</hi> and if he might live, he would ſtrive to regain the time he had ſo vainly ſpent: But having been a notorious Offender, received the reward of his Crimes, according to his Sentence.</p>
            <p>Thus may all looſe people ſee, and take warning by the untimely Ends of theſe poor Wretches, leſt the Devil tempt them to the like Villanies, and they wiſh they had been ſo wiſe as not to have done them, when it will be too late.</p>
